This is a patch for Contra Hard Corps (U) for the Sega Genesis.  In the version
of the game that was originally released in Japan, it was possible to take three 
hits before dying.  For unknown reasons, this functionality was removed when the 
game was released in the US, making the game vastly more difficult in the process.  
This patch restores the ability to take three hits, complete with the life bar .

In addition, this patch does the following:

-Restores the three cheat codes that were also present in the Japanese version 
but removed from the US version.  Note, however, that unlike the Japanese version, 
these codes are entered on controller ONE.

70 lives	At the main menu, press C, B, A, Right, Left, C, B, A, Right,
                Left, C, B, A, Right, Left.
All weapons	Pause game play and press Up(2), Down(2), A, Up(2), Down(2), B,
                Up(2), Down(2), C.
Level select	At the main menu, press A, B, C, Left, Right, A, B, C, Left, 
                Right, A, B, C, Left, Right.

-Up to ten lives can be selected in the menu.  (The default is three.)
-Player 1 and Player 2 can now select the same character.
-A new code is available that takes you to the game's debug level! Press Left, 
Right, Left, Right, A, B, C, B, A, Up Down.
