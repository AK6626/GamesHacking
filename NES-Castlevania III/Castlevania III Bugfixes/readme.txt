 Castlvania III: Dracula's Curse Color Bugfixes
  Version 1.0 - November 20th, 2005
  Created by Dragonsbrethren

=================================================================================================
 Information
=================================================================================================

  These are patches to fix a small number of color-related bugs in Castlevania III. Most of the
  item graphics in CV3 appeared in the first game as well, but with a different palette. When
  these graphics were reused in CV3 it seems the developers forgot to reorder the colors of a
  few of them. These patches correct these oversights.

 Questions
=================================================================================================

 Q. "Why did you make this patch?"

 A. Felt like it. I've known about these bugs for years, I decided to fix them.


 Q. "Are you sure they're bugs?"

 A. No. I'm almost certain the holy water is (It has a different graphic in Akumajo Densetsu)
    and I'm almost certain the money bag isn't.


 Q. "Will the patches work with Akumajo Densetsu?"

 A. With the exception of the patches with "cv3" in their title they will work fine.


 Q. "Why is there a seperate holy water fix for Akumajo Densetsu?"

 A. Akumajo Densetsu's holy water is in a different location in the ROM.
    It was terrible looking, they "fixed" the graphic for CV3 but it was still incorrect.


 Q. "Why didn't you restore the censored cross?"

 A. I don't know why people consider this censored. The Akumajo Densetsu cross had a lame
    "glowing" effect to it, the Castlevania III one is more realistic. "Fix" this yourself.


 Q. "Do you prefer Castlevania III or Akumajo Densetsu?"

 A. With the exceptions of music and censorship Castlevania III is supperior in everyway.
    Only "Japanophiles" feel the need to bash it for what were mostly corrections.


 Q. "Why didn't you make an enhancement patch for Akumajo Densetsu?"

 A. Didn't feel like it. I'm sure the Japanophiles would bitch if I did anyway.


 Q. What is the proper way to spell Akumajo Densetsu?"

 A. Nothing to do with these patches, but the game is also called:

	·Akumajo Densetsu (Used in the Castlevania Chronicles interview, "official" spelling)
	·Akumajou Densetsu (Most common)
	·Akumajyo Densetsu (Nintendo used this spelling for Akumajo Dracula)
	·Akumajyou Densetsu (Used in Vice Translation's patch)
