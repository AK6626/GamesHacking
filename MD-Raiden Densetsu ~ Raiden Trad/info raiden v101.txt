Raiden Trad/ Raiden Densetsu IPS patch version 1.01
30th Jul 2017

made with HivePAL,GIMP,TileLayerPro

==Purpose of the patch==
Seibu Kaihatsu's Raiden was ported to many systems. While the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive received a very accurate port in terms of content and an extra stage as bonus, the port's graphics were lackluster.
This hack aims to change that:
- fully reworked sprites, background tiles & color palettes 
- stage transistion scenes have been restored
- loading screen sequence (red eye & green tiles) restored
- most palette based animations restored, e.g. stage 1 river, stage 5 yellow lights on buildings, lamps and engines on enemies and player craft
- palettes frequently changed during stages for a closer look to the original (originally only used in stage 1 and 8)
- stage 9 (Sega Genesis/Megadrive exclusive) has been redrawn to fit into the series's visual style

==Usage==
Apply the included IPS file to the ROM (e.g. via Retron 5, Cybergadet Retrofreak, dedicated program such as "StealthPatch IPS Patcher").
If you get a red screen, the checksum needs to be fixed. Programs such as ESE FixCheckSum can do this for you.

==Version changes==
version 1.01
- fixed a wrongly colored tile in stage 6 (asteroid)
- fixed a wronlgy colored tile in stage 7 (first red lamp array)
 
==Notes==
*the original game supports all features for this hack out of the box (just had to insert a fork for the extra palette now used for the stage loading screen), however these were unused in most parts
*while one of the first 8 megabit games, the rom contains plenty of unused space
*the original game uses an undocumented compression mechanism. I wasn't able to figure it out, but could deactivate it. Therefore this hack exapnds the rom to insert graphics data, leaving the original graphics untoched 
*NTSC-U and NTSC-J version are identical, the game simply uses a different title screen based on the console region


==Legal stuff==
Do whatever you want with these files unless it's commercial, making money out of this etc. 
Feel free to further edit and resubmit.
